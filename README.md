# Hands-On Graph Neural Networks  

This repository contains code and experiments based on the book *Hands-On Graph Neural Networks* by Packt Publishing. The goal is to implement, adapt, and extend the concepts covered in the book to deepen understanding and apply Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to real-world problems.  

## Overview  

The repository is structured to align with the chapters and concepts from the book. It includes:  
- Implementations of GNN architectures like GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and others.  
- Tutorials and walkthroughs of graph-related tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.  
- Code for preprocessing graph data, building datasets, and visualizing graphs.  
- Custom implementations and adaptations of GNNs for advanced experimentation.
